Comparison Website
## About:
 Automated Product Price Comparison is an internet-based application so that users or shoppers can know the detail of different products offered by different websites. This website allows you to get quotes from a variety of firms or websites in a single stroke. This means you can make quick inquiries about what’s an offer across the market without having to search multiple websites of shopping. It gives consumers the chance to compare prices from different retailers at a single glance, helping them save money and letting them find good deals. The system will provide you with a snapshot of the market.
The main benefit is that the users don’t need to visit all the shopping websites, they’ll be given multiple options/choices to buy a product according to their desire.
